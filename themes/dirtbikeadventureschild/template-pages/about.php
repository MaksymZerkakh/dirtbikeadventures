            <p>In 2022 UP Dirt Bike Adventures was founded with a simple mission: Rent dirt bikes and promote all the wonderful trails, terrain, and scenery that the UP of Michigan has to offer.</p>
            <p>Wesley Bowerman and Brent LaFave of Munising MI had one goal in mind, affordable dirt bike rentals so all dirt bike enthusiasts could experience what the UP of Michigan has to offer.</p>
            <p>Wesley and Brent started UP Dirt Bikes Adventures shortly after they went back to the UP of Michigan from Colorado in June of 2022 on a dirt bike riding trip. They then realized there was a need for dirt bike rentals and they wanted to spread the word about this untouched terrain and how great the trails are.</p>
            <p>Wesley has spent the last 15 years out in Colorado where he has been riding the in Rocky Mountains and all the knarly single tracks Colorado has. He had recently shown his good buddy Brent who has also spent the last 20 plus years in Colorado the sport he enjoys. Brent soon grasped the concept of riding a dirt bike and fell in love with the sport immediately and now is a diehard rider. That’s how UP Dirt Bike Adventures was started, taking our passion and sharing the experience.</p>
            <p>They partnered with Race Driven Powersports out of Escanaba MI and purchased a new fleet of premium GasGas Dirt bikes. These dirt bikes are state of the art and can handle any terrain you throw at them.</p>
            <p>Whether you’re looking to ride the 2 track roads, take a rip the lengthy tight single tracks, ride the fast and flowy 50” trails , or send it on the motocross track, we’ve got you covered.</p>
            <p>Our rental process is simple, click and go! We took the logistical nightmare away from you by having dirt bike rentals ready and available to fill all your riding needs in the UP of Michigan.</p>
            <p>We have several drop off locations where we will meet you with the bikes, or you can come pick them up and take them to the destination of your chose. We also have guided tour options. Call for guided rental tour details.</p>
